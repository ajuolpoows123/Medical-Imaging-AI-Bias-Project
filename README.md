# Medical-Imaging-AI-Bias-Project
The goal is to develop and evaluate methods to detect and reduce demographic bias in AI models used for medical image analysis, ensuring fairness across diverse patient groups.
Data Collection and Preparation: Utilize publicly available datasets, ensure balanced splits across demographic groups.
Model Development: Implement and train a convolutional neural network (CNN).
Bias Detection: Analyze model performance across different demographic groups.
Bias Mitigation Techniques: Implement data augmentation, fairness-aware algorithms, and post-hoc adjustments.
Evaluation and Validation: Measure performance improvements with fairness metrics.
Documentation and Reporting: Summarize findings and visualize performance pre- and post-mitigation.
